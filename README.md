Client-server echo application

Desctiption

This project consists of two applications: client and server.
The Client application  can send messages to the server and receive messages from server in 2 modes:
1).Interactive mode
2).Single-message mode 

In both modes client has to establish connection to the server, send the message, and print out the server response. In interactive mode, client has to prompt user for additional messages, until no more messages are provided.

The main goal of this project is learning architecture of client-server.

What to do:
1)Go to the server directory and write in terminal ./build.sh
2)cd build
3)./server
4)Open another terminal
5) Go to the client directory and write in terminal ./build.sh
5.1). Start script start.sh(for test)
5.2
7) ./client (interactive mode) or ./client 3000 message (single message mode)
